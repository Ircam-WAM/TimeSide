User Interfaces
===============

Ipython
-------

To run the ipython shell, just do it through the docker composition::

    docker-compose run app ipython

Notebook
---------

You can also run your code in the wonderful `Jupyter Notebook <http://jupyter.org/>`_ which gives you a web interface to run your own code and share the results with your collaborators::

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f env/notebook.yml up

and then browse  http://localhost:8888 to access the Jupyter notebook interface. Use the token given in the docker logs of the `notebook` container to login.

.. warning :: Running a Jupyter notebook server with this setup in a non-secured network is not safe. See `Running a notebook server <http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.org/en/latest/public_server.html/>`_ for a documented solution to this security problem.


Use you own data
----------------

The `var/media` directory is mounted in `/srv/media` inside the container so you can use it to exchange data between the host and the app container.


Web Server
----------

TimeSide now includes an experimental web service with a REST API::

    git clone https://github.com/Parisson/TimeSide.git
    cd TimeSide
    docker-compose up db

This will pull all needed images for running the server and then initialize the database. Leave the session with CTRL+C and then finally do::

    docker-compose up

This will initialize everything and create a bunch a test sample boilerplate. You can browse the TimeSide API at:

    http://localhost:8000/timeside/api/

and the admin interface (login: admin, password: admin) at:

    http://localhost:8000/timeside/admin

.. note :: A documentation about using the objects and processors from the webserver will be written soon. We need help on this!

All (raw, still experimental) results are accessible at :

    http://localhost:8000/timeside/

.. tip :: On MacOS or Windows, replace "localhost" by the virtual machine IP given by `docker-machine ip timeside`

To process some data by hand in the web environment context, just start a django shell session::

    docker-compose run app manage.py shell

To run the webserver in background as a daemon, just add the `-d` option::

    docker-compose up -d


Batch
------

A shell script is provided to enable preset based and recursive processing through your command line interface::

 timeside-launch -h
