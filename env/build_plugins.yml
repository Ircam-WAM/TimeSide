# README :
# This compositon file enables to run the build command for plugins in development mode
# this was needed because Timeside-diadems IRIT_DIVERG2 plugin generated .so files in the timeside/plugins/diadems directory
# Those files were thus not present if the plugins setup was done only during the build and not with the lib/timeside-diadems volume mounted at run time
#
# Usage : docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f env/build.yml -f env/build_plugins.yml run app
#

services:
  app:
    volumes:
      - ./lib:/srv/lib/plugins
    command: /bin/bash /srv/app/bin/setup_plugins.sh
